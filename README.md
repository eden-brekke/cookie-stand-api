## Customization Steps for Template:

- DO NOT migrate yet
- add additional dependencies as needed
  - Re-export requirements.txt as needed
- change `things` folder to the app name of your choice
- Search through entire code base for `Thing`,`Things` and `things` to modify code to use your resource
  - `project/settings.py`
  - `project/urls.py`
  - App's files
    - `views.py`
    - `urls.py`
    - `admin.py`
    - `serializers.py`
    - `permissions.py`
- Update ThingModel with fields you need
  - Make sure to update other modules that would be affected by Model customizations. E.g. serializers, tests, etc.
- Rename `project/.env.sample` to `.env` and update as needed
- Run makemigrations and migrate commands
- Optional: Update `api_tester.py`

- Step 32: exit
- Step 33: docker compose down *you must do a rebuild after changing the env file*
- Step 34: docker compose up --build
- Step 35: docker compose run web bash
